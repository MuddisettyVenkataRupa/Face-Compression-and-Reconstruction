Face Compression and Reconstruction from scratch using PCA (Dimensionality Reduction Technique)
   The idea is to find Eigen Vectors among 10K images (perfectly aligned faces, which is a limitation of PCA). The coefficient of
the eigen vectors can then be used to compress face image, as they represent maximum information of a face and we can
reconstruct the face using just these values.

Dataset Used:
    LFW Dataset from kaggle
